            <h3>New Years 2019</h3>
            <p class="text-primary">I am intensely family oriented.  I grew up spending every holiday and vacation with my parents and my sister. I was incredibly lucky to have a caring and loving immediate as well as extended family. As such, they are my priority and I will extend my loyalty, trust and battle-hardened work ethic to any connections who acknowledge and understand that I highly value family time.</p>

          <h3> My Aunt and I tailgating at a Chiefs game.</h3>
          <p class="text-primary">I am a sports fan.  I like hitting the driving range, fly fishing, I play rec league soccer, and I will consume any live sports broadcast, but my favorites are football, hockey, and boxing, all closely followed by March Madness.</p>

          <h3>Me and some friends after a river float.</h3>
          <p class="text-primary">I prefer to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.  As such, I primarily bike everywhere. I refuse to go more than a day without a run or a workout. </p>

          <h3>Taking a breather on a bike ride to Cherry Creek Reservoir a la the Cherry Creek Bike Trail.</h3> 
          <p class="text-primary">And like every multi-celled organism in the Denver Front Range, I also enjoy hiking and off roading.</p>

          <h3>Panorama from a break on a grueling hiking trail</h3>
          <p class="text-primary">But by far, one of my favorite past times is to float rivers with my friends (obviously only in the summer).</p>

          <h3>Sabrina, my first dog I raised from a puppy, next to my baby nephew.</h3>
          <p class="text-primary">I've pet sat for over 15 years.  I officially started by watching 7 rescue dogs and 2 cats simultaneously on a family friend's farm.
          I get the most enjoyment out of getting to know each animal's personality.  They are all uniquely funny in their own way.  
          Some are early risers that'll beat me to dawn while others will sleep in longer than me and have to be woken to go outside. 
          Others are finicky eaters or happily entitled chunks that will eat another's food before they get the chance.</p>  
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/52pzRXj/IMG-0082.jpg">  
          <h3>My first cat Boomer</h3>
          <p class="text-primary">Boomer was born a farm cat then raised by me to love dogs, human contact, and follow his instincts to fearlessly explore, hunt, or befriend animals smaller or bigger than him. </p> 
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BZv2Yx3/IMG-0002.jpg">
          <h3>Here is Boomer indulging in a nap with my friend's Newfie-Lab mix.</h3>
          <p class="text-primary"> One of my strongest motivators for continuing to pet sit is that I miss having my own pets and living somewhere they can be accomodated.
          I have long found a lot of enjoyment from visiting dog parks or taking dogs on a walk.  In absence of pet ownership, I live vicariously by sitting for other's beloved pets. </p>
