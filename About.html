      <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw margin-right"></i>Mar. to Nov. 2018</h3>
      <p>Code Forward was founded by Devetry as a means to inject the Denver Tech scene with a fresh offering of marketable skills. The helm was captained by Senior Developer Brian Schiller accompanied with the mastery of Vincent Buscarello.  Many well established Software Engineers mentored the class and I consider every single one of them as a key contributor to my coding skillset. The curriculum started with Python on the backend, added Flask, HTML, CSS, and PostrgreSQL halfway through and finished up with deep dives into vanilla JavaScript a la <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> as well as numerous ventures into Vue.JS.  The course was finalized with a capstone project, which I am providing a link to below.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw margin-right"></i>Winter 2018</h3>
      <p><b>A social endorsement app where the user's profile is created by solicitations from their social circle.</b></p>
      <p>Built using:</p>

      <p><b><a href= "https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></b></p>

      <p><b><a href= "https://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/">its dangerous python library</a></b></p>
      <p>Encourage was the capstone project for my 2018 graduation from Coding Forward.  
         My aim was to inspire a social networking service where the user's profile is built entirely from input and solicitation by that user's own social network.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw margin-right"></i>May 2019 to Present</h3>
      <p>I'm providing web development services for this nonprofit by learning aspects of PHP, JavaScript, and front end web development / web design.  Presently, me and the staff are working on ideas for revamping the front end design.  I'm excited to have such a comfortable working relationship with this organization, hone my skills, and learn PHP and WordPress to advance my understanding of web development, specifically front end design.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw margin-right"></i>July 2019 to Present</h3>
      <p>I am contracted out to a recently retired couple to design and maintain their travel blog website.  Their site required a complete overhaul as the result of poor maintenance and overall service provided by Blue Host.  I had to completely rebuild every blog post from the chaos of SQL that was the only surviving backup thanks to BlueHost. I gave the site a complete design overhaul, implemented a fresh color scheme and upgraded the site from a simple list of blog posts to a media gallery of travel memories.</p>
