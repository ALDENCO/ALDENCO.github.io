                <p><a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L317aXSp8SbprEtwygW-vBc9K_YO3i3i/view?usp=sharing">Kim provided me with the best letter of recommendation I have received in my life:</a> </p>
            <p> To provide a little background:<a href ="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/03/23/boulder-denver-bbb-kimberly-states/70349882/">
                In 2015, Kim States took over as the CEO of the BBB Serving Denver/Boulder after serving 6 years as the CEO of the BBB in Southern Arizona.</a>  
                She inherited a BBB organization weak-kneed, underperforming, disorganized, and rife with toxicity and mishires. Upon our first meeting, she immediately recognized my value in my intelligence, customer rapport, analytical mind and grasp of business acumen. 
                In realizing she needed to reorganize the entire organation, from bottom up, she promised me and herself that I would be the assistant she would trust to be by her side. 
                She directed me to work side-by-side with her Executive and managerial staff, and dual Board of Directors, and all committee members to keep the air in the sails while she went to work shouldering the weight of her predecessors failures, chipping the diamond from the rough, and righting the ship to set us on a course toward daylight.</p>
<br>
            <p> I was there through it all.  From a simply slothily active non-profit to a nationally top performing, model BBB with influence to directly impact the national Council of Better Business Bureaus, Kim set me to task contributing and evaluating the vitality, atmosphere, and ethical integrity of her departments, Board members, and processes.
                She tasked me with the analyses, understanding of legal interpretation (as backed by national's counsel), and the administration of training for Board of Directors all citing National and local Bylaws, Standards, as well as Robert's Rules of Order in both her attendance and absence. </p>
<br>
            <p> In her absence, she trusted me to deliver her communication to staff, Board, and business contacts.  Mid growing pains, she asked me to treat her staff to an off site stress reliever, provided me with the overpriced estimates she'd already received, and trusted me to diligently research numerous options, negotiate price points, and find the highest value offer at the lowest cost. 
                I ultimately delivered thanks to Punch Bowl Social which I had frequented as a member of Denver Cruisers (a pubcrawl on bikes).  
                This serves as one shining memory of the many fruitful opportunities I was gifted at the hands of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/promo/denver-mentor/kimstates">a determined, genuine, optimistic and accomplished Chief Executive, strong and thoughtful woman, as well as a pragmatic and hard-working Coloradan.</a></p>
